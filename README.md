# Image Processing Labs

This repository contains all laboratory work for the **Image Processing** course.

The labs included here cover fundamental concepts and practical implementations related to digital image processing, such as image representation, enhancement, filtering, and analysis. All experiments and exercises are organized by lab number for clarity and easy navigation.

## Course Information
- **Course**: Image Processing  
- **Major**: Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
- **Academic Year**: Fourth Year  
- **Level**: Level 8  

## Repository Structure
Each lab is placed in a separate folder (e.g., `lab1`, `lab2`, etc.), and typically includes:
- Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`)
- Related image datasets
- Supporting resources needed to run the lab

This repository will be continuously updated as more labs are completed throughout the course.
